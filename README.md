# BatteryBoi - A Battery Indicator for Winners
### What
**BatteryBoi** (better name pending a [Twitter Poll](https://twitter.com/mistermeenr)) is a **replacement Battery Indicator for the MacOS Menu Bar**. <br><br>

### Why
The battery icon really needed an indicator for how much time is left in terms of minutes and hours. So as a fun evening project, I [@MisterMeenr](https://twitter.com/mistermeenr) made it. <br><br>

### How (to Install)

1. You can install the app by downloading the [latest released .DMG file](https://github.com/thebarbican19/BatteryBoi/releases/). This contains an executable version of the app - **you do not need to Xcode to run this.**
2. Open/mount the DMG file and drag BatteryBoi into the Applications Folder. And that's it!
3. You can hide the default battery icon by going to **System Preferences** > **Control Center** > **Battery** > **Show in Menu Bar**
<br><br>

#### Updates
BatteryBoi does not currently have support to perform automatic updates. Please 🚶🏻 follow or ⭐️ start this repo to follow for release updates. 
<br><br>

### Q&A
**Q.** Does this app steal my data? <br>
**A.** The app **only tracks installs** with [Enalog](https://github.com/thebarbican19/EnalogSwift). If you don't belive me, check the source code.
<br><br>
**Q.** Did you make any other sweet sweet apps I can try? <br>
**A.** Yeah, [SprintDock](https://sprintdock.app) is my masterpeice. Check it out!
<br><br>
**Q.** The estimated time does not show up. Why? <br>
**A.** Estimated time until battery depletion is calculated by the System. Sometimes this information just isn't available. When it isn't, it will fall back on the Battery Percentage. 
<br><br>
**Q.** Can I revert back to the old MacOS Battery Indicator?<br>
**A.** Yes! Go to **System Preferences** > **Control Center** > **Battery** > **Show in Menu Bar** and toggle it on.
