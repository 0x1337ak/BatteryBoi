# BatteryBoi - A Battery Indicator to Rule Them All!
**BatteryBoi** is a **replacement Battery Indicator for the MacOS Menu Bar**. <br><br>

## Why
The battery icon really needed an indicator for how much time is left in terms of minutes and hours. So as a fun evening project, I ([Mojito Joe](https://twitter.com/mistermeenr)) built it. 

<br>
However, because of popular demand, the scope of this project has expanded significantly to be a full-fledged, open-source, completely free battery app giving you beautiful notifications and insights into your battery, and even your connected devices (Bluetooth support coming very soon!).<br><br><br>

## How (to Install)

1. You can install the app by downloading the [latest released .DMG file](https://github.com/thebarbican19/BatteryBoi/releases/). This contains an executable version of the app - **you do not need to Xcode to run this.**
2. Open/mount the DMG file and drag BatteryBoi into the Applications Folder. And that's it!
3. You can hide the default battery icon by going to **System Preferences** > **Control Center** > **Battery** > **Show in Menu Bar**
<br><br><br>

### Works On...
**BatteryBoi** runs on **both Intel & Silicon (M1 & M2)** for the following MacOS versions
- 11.0 (Big Sur)
- 12.0 (Monterey)
- 13.0 (Ventura)
- 14.0 (Sonoma)
- 15.0 [(Big Chungus)](https://twitter.com/mistermeenr/status/1643378900313964544?s=20)

## Q&A
**Q.** Is the app GDPR compliment?<br>
**A.** BatteryBoi does not collect, store, process, or transfer any personal information as defined by Article 4, Section 1 of the GDPR
<br><br>
**Q.** Does this app steal my data? <br>
**A.** The app **only logs installs** with [Enalog](https://github.com/thebarbican19/EnalogSwift). <br><br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;The information captured in this logging event is... <br><br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; - **Device Architecture (Silicon or Intel)** <br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; - **MacOS Version Number**<br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; - **System Locale (ISO Country Code)** <br>
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; - **Theme (Dark/Light Mode)**. 
<br><br>
**Q.** What about Personal Data? <br>
**A.** No personal data or anything that can be remotely attributed to your person is collected, stored, processed, or transferred. 
<br><br>
**Q.** Did you make any other sweet sweet apps I can try? <br>
**A.** Yeah, [SprintDock](https://sprintdock.app) is my masterpeice. Check it out!
<br><br>
**Q.** The estimated time does not show up. Why? <br>
**A.** Estimated time until battery depletion is calculated by the System. Sometimes this information just isn't available. When it isn't, it will fall back on the Battery Percentage. 
<br><br>
**Q.** Can I revert back to the old MacOS Battery Indicator?<br>
**A.** Yes! Go to **System Preferences** > **Control Center** > **Battery** > **Show in Menu Bar** and toggle it on. 
<br><br>

## Spare some change?
In a world where almost every app has a recurring fee, **BatteryBoi is and will remain open-source and free for everybody!** But if you want to support future development and see some of the roadmap items implemented, then consider donating via our website [batteryboi.ovatar.io](https://batteryboi.ovatar.io/) or via  my [GitHub Sponsor page](https://github.com/sponsors/thebarbican19).
<br><br>
**Can't afford to pay?** Don't you stress about it! You can support the project simply by sharing it with whoever has a Mac, or even just by ⭐️ this project.
<br><br>
