# BatteryBoi - A Battery Indicator for Winners
### What?
**BatteryBoi** (better name pending a [Twitter Poll](https://twitter.com/mistermeenr)) is a **replacement Battery Indicator for the MacOS Menu Bar**. <br><br><br>

### Why?
The battery icon really needed an indicator for how much time is left in terms of minutes and hours. So as a fun evening project, I [@MisterMeenr](https://twitter.com/mistermeenr) made it. <br><br><br>

### Removing the Default
You can remove the default MacOS battery icon by holding *Command * & dragging the battery icon off the Menu Bar, releasing it will remove it. <br><br><br>

### Roadmap
This is just a fun project however, with your support, I will be adding...

- [X] **🔋 Battery Replacement**
- [ ] **🚨 Improved Alerts**
- [ ] **🏝️ A Dynamic Island-Style Modal with Sexy Indicator**
- [ ] **📈 More Stats**

### Q&A
**Q** Does this app steal my data? <br>
**A** No, there's no tracking. Look at the code if you don't belive me.
<br><br>
**Q** Did you make any other sweet sweet apps I can try? <br>
**A** Yeah, [SprintDock](https://sprintdock.app) is my masterpeice. Check it out!
<br><br>
**Q** The estimated time does not show up? <br>
**A** Estimated time until battery deplition is calculated by the System. Sometimes this information just isn't available. When it isn't, it will fall back on the Battery Percentage.
