# BatteryBoi - A Battery Indicator for Winners
### What?
**BatteryBoi** (better name pending a [Twitter Poll](https://twitter.com/mistermeenr)) is a **replacement Battery Indicator for the MacOS Menu Bar**. <br><br><br>

### Why?
The battery icon really needed an indicator for how much time is left in terms of minutes and hours. So as a fun evening project, I [@MisterMeenr](https://twitter.com/mistermeenr) made it. <br><br><br>

### Removing the Default
You can remove the default MacOS battery icon by holding *Command * & dragging the battery icon off the Menu Bar, releasing it will remove it. <br><br><br>

### Roadmap
This is just a fun project however, with your support, I will be adding...

- [X] **Battery Replacement**
- [ ] **Improved Alerts**
- [ ] **A Dynamic Island-Style Modal with Sexy Indicator**
- [ ] **More Stats**
- [ ] **Custom Keyboard Shortcuts**

<br><br><br>

### This is so good - Take My Money. 
**BatteryBoi is FREE for everybody!** But if you want to support future development and see some of the roadmap items implemented, then consider donating. 

Thank you for your consideration.
